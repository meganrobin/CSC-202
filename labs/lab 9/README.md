# Lab 9: Exploring Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

## Overview
In this lab, you will delve into the practical applications and operations of Binary Search Trees (BSTs). You will implement algorithms to convert a sorted list into a balanced BST, verify the validity of a BST, and compare two trees to determine if they are identical.

## Objectives
- Understand the properties and operations of BSTs.
- Apply algorithms to manipulate and analyze BSTs.
- Enhance problem-solving skills with data structures.

## Setup
- Ensure you have a Python environment set up.
- Download the starter code provided for each task.

## Task 1: Convert a Sorted List to a BST
Given a sorted list of integers, your goal is to create a balanced BST with minimal height. The sorted list represents an in-order traversal of the BST you need to construct.

**Requirements:**
- Write a function that takes a sorted list as input and returns the root node of the BST.
- Ensure the resulting BST is balanced to achieve minimal height.

## Task 2: Is It a Valid BST?
Determine if a given binary tree is a valid BST. A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be BSTs.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a function that takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns `True` if it's a valid BST, and `False` otherwise.

## Task 3: Are These Trees the Same?
Given the roots of two binary trees, write a function to check if they are identical. Two binary trees are considered identical if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Requirements:**
- Your function should return `True` if the two trees are identical, and `False` otherwise.

## Submission Guidelines
- Complete the code for each task in its respective file.
- Ensure your code passes all the test cases.
- Submit your code files for all three tasks.
